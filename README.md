This is a simple todo app, created to demonstrate skills in basic React, Redux, unit testing (Jest and Enzyme) as well as functional testing (comming soon).

To run unit tests, clone repository and use "yarn run test".

I will add some functional testing suites soon (Pupeteer and TestCafe).

App is available in workable version on https://todos-react-ts.herokuapp.com/

IMPORTANT- test user is for local use only, does not work in production.
